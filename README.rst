**Important note:** this PHP library is still on development and should be considered as a beta version!


Documentation
-------------

The Backend client PHP class is commented but do not have a dedicated documentation.

It implements the same interface as the Python client which is documented and that you can refer to if needed `in this online documentation <http://alignak-backend-client.readthedocs.io/>`_

The `Alignak backend documentation <http://alignak-backend.readthedocs.io/>`_ will also be really helpful to you ;)


Release strategy
----------------

Alignak backend and its *satellites* (backend client, and backend import tools) must all have the
same features level. As of it, take care to install the same minor version on your system to
ensure compatibility between all the packages. Use 0.4.x version of Backend import and Backend
client with a 0.4.x version of the Backend.
